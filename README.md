#PPG-Signal-Dataset
This dataset contains 56 records of PPG signals with a duration of 2 minutes each (fs = 100 Hz). None of the subjects were hospitalized, and data collection was carried out in a Laboratory. The data set aims to support the development of approaches to estimate blood pressure from the analysis of PPG signals.
##Data Files
This dataset is distributed in four formats:
- .csv (comma separated values).
- .mat (MatLab).
- .txt (Text file).
- .yaml (YAML ain't Markup Language).
